# React YouTube clone app

## :book: How to use

This is a YouTube clone application. You can search videos by keywords. When you search, videos related to the keyword will be displayed. When you select one of them, you will be taken to a detailed page where you can play it. Also, a video list related to the one you choose will be displayed in the side area. Enjoy videos the same as you do on YouTube!

You need to convert your resume into a JSON file in advance. Then, name the file `resume.json` and put it in the root.<br>
Here is [an example of the structure of a JSON file](https://github.com/marieooq/resume_json_html/blob/master/resume.json).

## :thumbsup: What I worked on

- Used CSS custom properties <br>
