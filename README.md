# React YouTube clone app

## :book: How to use

This is a YouTube clone application. You can search videos by keywords. When you search, videos related to the keyword will be displayed. When you select one of them, you will be taken to a detailed page where you can play it. Also, a video list related to the one you choose will be displayed in the side area. Enjoy videos the same as you do on YouTube!

## :warning: Note
You have to create an API key on [YouTube developer page](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) in advance. After that, please make sure to create .env file in the root and write your API key like this.

## :thumbsup: What I worked on

- Used CSS custom properties <br>
  I used CSS custom properties instead of other CSS libraries, to make it easy to modify the style even later.
