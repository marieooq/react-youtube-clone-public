# React YouTube clone app

## :book: How to use

This is a YouTube clone app. You can search keywords which you'd like to find videos related to. After searching them, the videos related the keywords will be displayed. Once you choose one of them, you'll jump to the detail page that you can play. Also, a vido list related the video you chose as a side list.

Here is [an example of the structure of a JSON file](https://github.com/marieooq/resume_json_html/blob/master/resume.json).
