# React YouTube clone app

## :book: How to use

This is a YouTube clone application. You can search videos by keywords. When you search, videos related to the keyword will be displayed. When you select one of them, you will be taken to a detailed page where you can play it. Also, a video list related to the one you choose will be displayed in the side area. Enjoy videos the same as you do on YouTube!

## :warning: Note
You have to create an API key on [YouTube developer page](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) in advance. After that, please make sure to create .env file in the root and write your API key like this.
```
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY="*************************"

## :thumbsup: What I worked on
- Used [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) 
- Used styled components <br>
- Used context API to manage React state
- Unit testing using Jest and React-testing-library. I tested fetching data from mock APIs and displaying the data correctly in the DOM. Also, I wrote a blog about this topic. You can check the blog at the link "Medium" at the bottom of this page.
